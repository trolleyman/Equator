# Equator
Simple equation viewer in Rust.

## Todo:
- [x] Conversion from equation into simple form (e.g. (2*2)/(3+5) as opposed to a multi-level fraction.)
- [X] Convert from this simple form into simple instructions (e.g. 5+3*2 => 5 3 2 * + , sqrt(2x+5) => 2 x * 5 + sqrt)
- [X] Execute these instructions
- [ ] Add fractions
- [ ] Add more functions -- ln, log, hyperbolics, |x|, factorials
- [ ] Add constants -- e, pi
- [ ] MAJOR - Change number system to base 10. This allows for more accurate calculations, as base 10 is used more in everyday life
- [ ] MAJOR - Add 'infinite precision' numbers - surds, fractions, irrational constants and coefficients of these
- [ ] MAJOR - Add multiple types of numbers -- complex, matrices, etc.
