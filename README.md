# Equator
Simple equation viewer/editor written in Rust.

## Instructions

Type with your keyboard or press the buttons in the app to insert the mathematical constructs into the equation. The right hand side is automatically updated with the evaluation of the expression. You can navigate the equation by clicking where you want the cursor, or alternatively you can use the arrow keys.

Variables can be assigned to by pressing the STORE key and pressing a button in the app or a variable on your keyboard. The variable's value will be set to the right hand side of the equation. Constants such as pi (π), e and the golden ratio (φ) cannot be assigned to.

## Todo:
Status | Task
------ | -------------
Todo | Add more functions -- log/ln
In progress | ** Change number system to base 10. This allows for more accurate calculations, as base 10 is used more in everyday life **
Depends on ^ | Add 'infinite precision' numbers - surds, fractions, irrational constants and coefficients of these
Depends on ^ | Add multiple types of numbers -- complex, matrices, etc.
